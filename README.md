   This repository contains the files for the project **Predicting Exercise Activity Quality**.
   
   Following are the main files in this repository :
   
   PML_Project.html    :  HTML file for viewing complete project report including R Code.
   
   PML_Project.Rmd     :  The main **Rmd** file for reproducing complete report. It is recommended to use RStudio
                          for that. Please note that due to use of multiple algorithms, total processing time
						  on a laptop/desktop PC is about 15 minutes.
   
   PML_Project.md      :  Markdown file for the project.
   
   
   Following are project's instructions as from the assignment notes :
   
   Background

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand and Fitbit, it is now possible to collect a large amount 
of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified 
self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their 
health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people 
regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well 
they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, 
and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 
5 different ways. More information is available from the 
website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har 
(see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset). 

Data

If you use the document you create for this class for any purpose please cite 
them as they have been very generous in allowing their data to be used for 
this kind of assignment. 

Course Project Prediction Quiz Portion

Apply your machine learning algorithm to the 20 test cases available in the test data above 
and submit your predictions in appropriate format to the Course Project Prediction Quiz for 
automated grading. 

Reproducibility

Due to security concerns with the exchange of R code, your code will not be run during the 
evaluation by your classmates. Please be sure that if they download the repo, they will be able 
to view the compiled HTML version of your analysis.
